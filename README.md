# CChat

## Starting the server

```bash
DEBUG=myapp:* npm start
```

Note that npm (the package manager we used to install the express generator) is also making our CChat program into a package.  That's why we had to run the npm install command on our app.  The actual command to start the server is inside *package.json* in the scripts section.
